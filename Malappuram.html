                  <h3>Nilambur</h3>
                  <p>Nilambur, most popularly known as the land of teak plantations, is a famous town in Malappuram district. The place is noted for its vast expanse of forest along with its varied wildlife habitats, rivers and waterfalls. It is situated close to the Nilgiri range of the Western Ghats on the banks of the Chaliyar River. Considered to be the oldest in the world, the teak plantation here obtained its name after H.V. Conolly, the Malabar district collector during the British rule. He was instrumental in planting teak in the entire Nilambur area. Chathu Menon, a forest officer under Conolly, organised the hectic task of planting the saplings. Chathu Menon was laid to rest in the teak garden in Conolly's Plot.</p>
                  <p>The teak plantation in Nilambur is situated about four kilometres from the town, on the Nilambur - Gudallur road. A well-equipped teak museum is another attraction of Nilambur. This museum is a sub-centre of the Kerala Forest Research Institute. Arranged in the two-storeyed building are exhibits, articles and details of historic, aesthetic and scientific value, which give information on all aspects of the teak to visitors.</p>

                    <h3>Kottakkunnu</h3>
                    <p>Situated near the district collectorate in Malappuram, Kottakkunnu, is a recently developed tourist spot in the district. Kottakkunnu derives its name from an old fort, which was built by the Zamorins of Kozhikode (in Malayalam kotta means fort and kunnu means hill). One can still find here traces of this fort. </p>
                    <p>The Municipality of Malappuram City has started Kottakkunnu Amusement park - a water theme park in the valley of Kottakunnu. Visitors are allowed up to 9 p.m. Nearby Kottakkunnu is the famous Vettakkorumakan temple and the Siva temple with several murals of Malabar.</p>

                    <h3>Keralamkundu Waterfalls</h3>
                    <p>A basin at the base of waterfalls where people can enjoy a dip in the pond is something everyone wants to have an experience. Keralam Kundu Waterfalls are undoubtedly the best of all Malappuram Tourist Places, and that is why people keep flocking here to have an experience of the mystical. </p>
                    <p>The water flows in from the forest of the western ghat and forms a pool of crystal clear water at the base of the falls. Also, it is believed that the water has many medicinal properties.</p>
