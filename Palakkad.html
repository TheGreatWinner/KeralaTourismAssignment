                    <p>Malampuzha Garden in Palakkad district is the only rock-cut garden in South India made by Nek Chand, the renowned artist and winner of the prestigious Padmashree Award. The entire garden is made from broken pieces of bangles, tiles, used plastic cans, tins and other waste materials. Also situated in the gardens is the massive Malampuzha Yakshi (female vampire) built in 1969 by Kanayi Kunhiraman, a greatly respected sculptor from the state.</p>
                    <p>It is a spectacular relic of art that we are lucky to still have with us. The flowering beds, fountains and rose gardens along with an aerial ropeway make it a place that instantly soothes your soul.

                    <p>Tipu's Fort, also known as Palakkad Fort, is a beautifully maintained edifice in Palakkad district and was an important military base in the past. Rebuilt by Hyder Ali in the 18th century, the fort was under the Mysore rulers until the British took control of the place. It was then used for providing government services during the British era. Named after Hyder's son Tipu Sultan, it is an important historical destination today.</p>
                    <p>It is among the best preserved forts in South India. The thick laterite walls impress all who view it. People frequent the spot for relaxing walks and jogs. A large ground that lies between the Fort and the Palakkad town hall is an important location for public meetings and important functions.</p>

                    <p>Choolannur Pea Fowl Sanctuary or Mayiladumpara, as it is locally known, is a premier haven for peacocks in Kerala. Getting to the 500-hectare enclosure of the sanctuary, located in Palakkad district, requires a trek through dense forests. The view however makes up for it immediately.</p>
                    <pOne is enraptured by the vivid colours and majestic shades of this kingly species. At this pristinely maintained heaven, dawn and dusk tend to be the best viewing times. Photographers can capture unique shots of peacocks here along with many other rare bird species and medicinal herbs.></p>
